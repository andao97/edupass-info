        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <div class="meta">Effective date: October 22, 2025</div>

        <p>By downloading or using the EduPass app, you agree that these Terms and Conditions will automatically apply
            to you. Please read them carefully before using the app. You are not permitted to copy, modify, or reproduce
            the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You may not attempt to extract the app’s source
            code, translate it into other languages, or create derivative versions. The app, along with all associated
            trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights, remains the exclusive
            property of EduPass.</p>

        <p>EduPass is dedicated to making the app as useful and efficient as possible. Therefore, we reserve the right
            to modify the app, update its features, or introduce charges for its services at any time and for any
            reason. No charges for the app or its services will be applied without a clear explanation of what they
            cover.</p>

        <p>The app collects and processes personal data you provide in order to deliver our services. It is your
            responsibility to maintain the security of your device and your access to the app. We strongly recommend
            that you do not jailbreak or root your device, as doing so may compromise security features, expose your
            device to malware, and prevent the app from functioning correctly.</p>

        <p>The app may utilize third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions, including but not limited
            to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank"
                    style="color:#2563eb;text-decoration:underline;">Google Play Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics" target="_blank"
                    style="color:#2563eb;text-decoration:underline;">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics" target="_blank"
                    style="color:#2563eb;text-decoration:underline;">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
        </ul>


        <p>EduPass cannot accept responsibility for certain aspects of app usage. Some features require an active
            internet connection, either via Wi-Fi or your mobile network. We are not liable if the app does not function
            fully due to a lack of connectivity or insufficient mobile data.</p>

        <p>If you use the app outside a Wi-Fi area, your mobile network provider’s terms still apply. You may be charged
            for data usage while using the app, including roaming charges if you access it outside your home region or
            country with data roaming turned on. By using the app, you accept responsibility for any such charges. If
            you are not the bill payer for the device, you must have permission from the bill payer to use the app.</p>

        <p>Similarly, EduPass is not responsible for ensuring your device remains charged. If your device runs out of
            battery and you are unable to access the app, we cannot accept liability for any resulting inability to use
            the service. Additionally, while we make efforts to provide accurate and up-to-date information through the
            app, we rely on third parties for certain content and accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
            resulting from reliance on this app's functionality.</p>

        <p>From time to time, we may update the app. The app is currently available on Android, but system requirements
            (and requirements for any other platforms we may release the app on) may change. You will need to download
            updates if you wish to continue using the app. EduPass does not guarantee that the app will always remain
            compatible with your device or that it will continue to meet your needs. However, you agree to accept all
            updates to the app when they are offered to you.</p>

        <p>EduPass may also discontinue the app or terminate your access at any time without notice. Unless we state
            otherwise, upon termination:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>(a) The rights and licenses granted to you under these terms will end;</li>
            <li>(b) You must stop using the app and, if necessary, delete it from your device.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 style="font-size:16px;margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:8px">Changes to Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms and Conditions periodically. You are encouraged to review this page regularly for
            any changes. Updated Terms will be posted on this page, and your continued use of the app constitutes
            acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
